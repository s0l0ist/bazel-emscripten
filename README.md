# Hello World (C++ to WASM/JS) using Bazel with Emscritpen

This repository demonstrates compiling C++ code with Bazel to either WebAssembly or plain JavaScript.

Works with the following versions (as of 3/21/2021):
- bazel 4.0.0
- emscripten 2.0.15

### [Link to blog post](https://medium.com/@s0l0ist/c-to-webassembly-using-bazel-and-emscripten-ae797c119bef)

Specifically, it illustrates how to integrate multiple `cc_library` targets from different packages to compile a JavaScript file containing WASM or just pure JS.

This approach uses a git submodule for emscripten and configures it as an external resource for bazel to use. Other methods such as using http_resource or git_repository are possible, but are not as easily configured. PRs welcome!

The generated outputs have been configured in 'single file' mode. This means instead of handling a separate `.wasm` file, the wasm binary is encoded as a base64 string and is embedded into a JS file along with emscripten's glue code. The result is a single file that works in almost any environment provided it supports WebAssembly (the JS variant will always work) without the need to host, serve, or initialize a `.wasm` binary directly. The caveat is that the file size is 33% larger due to the encoding.

## Requirements

This project assumes you have [bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html)

## Code structure

- [hello-world](hello-world) holds all the sources
- [hello-world/cpp](hello-world/cpp) C++ sources
- [hello-world/javascript](hello-world/javascript) JavaScript sources
- [hello-world/javascript/toolchain](hello-world/javascript/toolchain) Bazel + Emscripten config
- [submodules](submodules) holds the emsdk source

## Compiling

First, clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/s0l0ist/bazel-emscripten.git
npm run submodule:update

// or

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/s0l0ist/bazel-emscripten.git
```

Second, you need to set up emscripten using the emsdk:

```
// Updates emscripten tags
npm run em:update

// Install the latest emscripten release and activate it
npm run em:init
```

Now, you can simply run a script to build both the JS and the WASM outputs:

```
npm run build
```

To build only one variant:

```
npm run build:js
// or
npm run build:wasm
```

To bundle:

```
npm run rollup
```

To clean the repository:

```
npm run clean
```

## Example

After you have built and bundled the code, you can choose to run a variant:

- `npm run demo:js` to run the JS variant
- `npm run demo:wasm` to run the WASM variant

```
npm run demo:wasm

> RUN_DEMO=wasm node ./hello-world/javascript/examples/demo.js

Hello, World!
